# Pandas vs Polars Benchmark

This project benchmarks **Pandas** vs **Polars** for common data engineering operations on dynamic datasets, demonstrating how Polars can significantly outperform Pandas, especially on larger datasets or multi-column operations.

---

## **Project Overview**

- Compare execution times of Pandas and Polars across various data operations.
- Supports **dynamic dataset size** (`--rows`) and **extra numeric columns** (`--extra-cols`).
- Benchmarks include:
  - Selecting and filtering columns
  - Adding, updating, dropping columns
  - Aggregations (mean, max) and group-by
  - Sorting, sampling, distinct, string & datetime operations
  - Cumulative sums, rolling means, conditional updates
- Generates **CSV summary** and **visual plot** automatically.

---

## **Why Polars is Faster**

Polars is designed for **high-performance data processing**:

- **Columnar memory layout** → faster vectorized operations  
- **Lazy execution and multithreading** → parallel processing  
- **Efficient memory usage** → handles larger-than-memory datasets  

In benchmarks:

- Polars outperforms Pandas in almost all operations.
- Multi-column operations and aggregation show the highest speedups (up to 90% faster).

## **Visual Benchmark Results**

Below is an example plot generated by the benchmark:

![Polars vs Pandas Performance](plots/benchmark_plot_5000000_rows_5_cols.png)

- **Green bars** → Polars execution time (faster)  
- **Gray bars** → Pandas execution time  
- **+% label** → Percentage improvement of Polars over Pandas  
- Operations are sorted by **Polars performance improvement**, so the largest advantages appear at the top

## **How to Run**

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandas_polars_benchmark.git
cd pandas_polars_benchmark
```
2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Run the benchmark**
```
python benchmark_run.py --rows 500000 --extra-cols 5
```
4. **Generates CSV summary in the project folder.**
5. **Auto-generates plot in plots/ folder.**

## **Conclusion**


This project clearly demonstrates that **Polars can drastically speed up data operations**, making it ideal for **ETL pipelines, analytics, and large-scale data processing**. <br>
Visualizations help identify which operations benefit the most from Polars’ high-performance architecture.

## **Optional Tips**
Adjust --rows to test larger datasets.<br>
Adjust --extra-cols to include more numeric columns.
